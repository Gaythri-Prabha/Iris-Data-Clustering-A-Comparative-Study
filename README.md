# Iris-Data-Clustering-A-Comparative-Study
This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques on the Iris dataset using K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. The goal is to group flowers into natural clusters based on their sepal and petal measurements, without using species labels.
ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Loaded and cleaned the dataset, removing species labels.
âœ… K-Means Clustering â€“ Applied K-Means and evaluated performance using the Silhouette Score (0.5528).
âœ… Hierarchical Clustering â€“ Visualized cluster formation with a dendrogram and achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.5175.
âœ… Cluster Visualization â€“ Compared clustering methods using scatter plots.

ðŸ“Š Conclusion:

K-Means performed slightly better in separating clusters.
Hierarchical Clustering provided deeper insights into cluster relationships.
This analysis demonstrates the strengths and trade-offs of both methods in unsupervised learning.
